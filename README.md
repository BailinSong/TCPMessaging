## Welcome to TCPMessaging

It shows how a core Java 8 TCP-multithreaded server can be set-up to process client requests. The specific use case is about messaging, i.e., a simulated chat; clients send messages to themselves.

### Roadmap

There's still much to come:
1. A web service layer, which will allow backend functionalities like a message store, based on MongoDB.
2. A UI, which will show the messaging live.
